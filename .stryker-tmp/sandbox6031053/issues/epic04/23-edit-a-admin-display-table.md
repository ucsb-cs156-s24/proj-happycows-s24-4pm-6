As an admin, I should be able to edit a table with the information of all the commons.

Reuse the Create Commons React file to generate an edit method for the table.

Table should include:

* Link to view report
* Button to delete report
* Report Number
* Report Date

As well as information about each common like 

* Milk Price 
* Cow Price 
* And other information as available on the Create Common Page

And! 

* Should be able to modify each of the prices and other information about the commons
* Should be able to save those changes (edit button becomes a save button)
